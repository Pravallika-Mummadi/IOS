// 1. In which year was the first version of the Swift programming language introduced?
print("The first version of Swift programming language was introduced in the year 2014")
print("----------------------")
// End of question 1


// 2. Declare a constant 'pi' of type Double and assign it the value 3.14. Calculate the circumference of a circle with a radius of 7.5 using the formula: circumference = 2 * pi * radius. Print the obtained result.
let pi : Double = 3.14
var r = 7.5
var circumference = (2*pi*r)
print(circumference)
print("----------------------")
// End of question 2


// 3. Declare a variable with a value of 98.8Â°F, convert it to Celsius, and round it to two decimal places. Then, print the result in the following format using a single print statement. [Replace the **** with converted celsius value.]
// Fahrenheit: 98.8 F
// Celsius:    **** C
var Fahrenheit = 98.8
var Celcius = ((Fahrenheit - 32) * 5)/9
var Celcius1 = String(format: "%.2f", Celcius)

print("Fahrenheit: \(Fahrenheit) F")
print("Celcius : \(Celcius1) C")

print("----------------------")
// End of question 3


// 4. Write three sentences about yourself using three print statements and display the first two sentences on the first line, and the third sentence on the next line.
print("Hello, I am Pravallika Mummadi.",terminator: "")
print("I am passionate about Computer science course, So i have taken Applied Computer Science for my masters.")
print("I am a Student at Northwest Missouri State Univerisity.")
print("----------------------")
// End of question 4



// 5. Display the following using a single print statement.
// "Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.
//   Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features   developers love.
//   Swift code is safe by design and produces software that runs lightning-fast."

// 6. Declare a variable named 'number' and assign it a minimum three-digit integer value. Write code to count the number of digits in the number and print the result. For example, if the number is 987654, the output should be: 'The number 987654 has 6 digits.'

var number = 100
var count=0
var number1=number
while number1 != 0{
    number1 = number1/10
    count = count+1
}
print("The number \(number) has \(count) digits.")
print("----------------------")
// End of question 6



// 7. Create a variable with value "Welcome to iOS Class". And then print each character separated by ",". Exlcude the spaces.


var value = "Welcome to iOS Class"
//taking an empty String to manipulate the String
var result = ""
// iterating for each character in the string
for char in value {
    // if char is not a space
    if char != " " {
        //converting char to to string and adding with a comma
        result += String(char) + (",")
    }
}

// Removing the ending comma
if !result.isEmpty {
    result.removeLast()
}
//printing the result String
print(result)
// End of question 7
